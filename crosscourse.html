            <div class="stickynote">
              <span>
                <img src="/images/pin_icon.png" alt="illustration of a pin" />
              </span>
              <h3>What?</h3>
              <p>Fixing repetition on css codes. Less repetition.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>
              There is always improvements to find. Especially since this was an
              early course project, with not so much skills.
            </p>
            <h3>How?</h3>
            <p>
              Going through the CSS, removing unneccessary codes. Checking
              classes, changing to more relative names.
            </p>

              <span>
                <img src="/images/pin_icon.png" alt="illustration of a pin" />
              </span>
              <h3>What?</h3>
              <p>Put some styling on the contact form.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>
              The contact form looks too standard, and not very appealing or
              fitting the theme.
            </p>
            <h3>How?</h3>
            <p>
              Rounding off borders. Better interaction to show the users they
              can interact with it.
            </p>

              </span>
              <h3>What?</h3>
              <p>Image modal on inspiration page</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>The page is too boring. Needs to be more engaging.</p>
            <h3>How?</h3>
            <p>
              Putting an hover effect on the images to show they are clickable.
              The border-radius are removed when clicked, showing the whole
              image. Clicking outside closes the image modal.
            </p>

              </span>
              <h3>What?</h3>
              <p>Hover effects on products page.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>The page is not very engaging. Nothing happens on it.</p>
            <h3>How?</h3>
            <p>
              Making an hover effect makes the user interact with it, and also
              shows the product better.
